Hey so your looking to contribute to the project! Awesome welcome in!

Please just follow these simple rules. 
1. Play the game! Can't really contribute if you don't play the game right? Also a good way to find bugs.
2. Check out the issues channel in the git. Issues are posted there and are open for someone to look at unless completed.
3. Pull a copy to yourself, tinker and if you can fix the code, send a pull request so we can review it.
